Welcome to the realm of complex numbers!
Change-log for MathMod-11.1 (16/06/2021)
1) Support of graphing functions with complex numbers Z=u+iv in 3D and 4D spaces (demo scripts: "Complex3D_xx" and "Complex4D_Saddle")
2) Added support for HSV (hue, saturation, lightness) coloring model (script: "Complex_Domain_Coloring")
3) Texture definitions (RGB and HSV) for parametric surfaces can now be expressed as functions of complex numbers
4) Added a software implementation for the OpenGL variable gl_FrontFacing (fixed an issue with GPU drivers on MacOSX Catalina).
   The activation of this patch is available from mathmodconfig.js ("OpenGlConfig"-->"GL_FrontFacingSupport"=false)
    or the GUI("Appearance"-->"OpenGL Front Surface Support")
5) Bug-fixes, code optimization and documentation update.
